Code for Lickley and Fletcher paper

The figures and results from this paper can be generated by running the MainScript_EF_RR.m file. 
All GCMs used in this analysis are listed in the SI of manuscript and in the preprocess_EFSubmission.m file. 
If running this code for the first time, set load_cru = 1 and create_pr_6x6 = 1. 
In addition, set calibrating_model = 1. 

Preprocessing the GCM data and model calibration may take several hours to days on a laptop.  
The remainder of the code takes several minutes to generate figures and results.
