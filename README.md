# Bayesian-estimation-of-advanced-warning-time-of-precipitation-emergence
Code for Lickley and Fletcher paper submitted to Earth's Future in August 2023, and revised in December 2023. 

The figures and results from this paper can be generated by running the MainScript_EF_RR.m file. 
All GCMs used in this analysis are listed in the SI of manuscript and in the preprocess_EFSubmission.m file. 
If running this code for the first time, set load_cru = 1 and create_pr_6x6 = 1. 

If using different models, set calibrating_model = 1. Alternatively, the hyperparameters estimated in model calibration are contained in the LOOCV_test_hyperparameter_selectionfull_Dec2023.mat file. 

Preprocessing the GCM data and model calibration may take several hours to days on a laptop.  
The remainder of the code takes several minutes to generate figures and results.
